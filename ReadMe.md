# File Downloader

I made this application to assist me in preparing a Christmas gift. The gift is for an Analogue
Pocket. That's a hardware emulator for old game consoles and arcade cabinents. I need to get the 
gift in the mail tomorrow, but I need some more time to get the system prepared for Christmas. 
My compromise is that I'm shipping the device with a microSD card that has a downloader on it. 
The receiver will only need to run the executable that I'm copying to the SD card to download the
firmware and games that I want to include with the gift.
